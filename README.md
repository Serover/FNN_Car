# FNN_Car
a feed forward neural network analyzing "your" driving to learn and drive a car around a simple track.


R to record
T to train
P to play

need to be done in order, in the build there's no hint to when each one is done, the recording is time based, roughly 1 lapse, the time to train is obviously computer based but should take less then 1 sec, and play is play.
